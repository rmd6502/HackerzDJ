this project may require xcode 4 - there seems to be a problem with some of the XIBs.

You'll need to create your own "uncommon_configs.h", containing the following definitions:

#define kYoutubeBodyCommon  @"v=2&alt=json&key=<youtube API key>"
#define kYoutubeDevKey      @"<youtube API key again>"
#define kClientAuthUsername @"<youtube username>"
#define kClientAuthPassword @"<youtube password>"
